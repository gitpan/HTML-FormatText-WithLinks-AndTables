HTML-FormatText-WithLinks-AndTables

This module was inspired by HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has proven to be a
useful `lynx -dump` work-alike. However one frustration was that no other HTML
converters I came across had the ability to deal affectively with HTML <TABLE>s.
This module can in a rudimentary sense do so. The aim was to provide facility to take
a simple HTML based email template, and to also convert it to text with the <TABLE>
structure in tact for inclusion as "multipart/alternative" content. Further, it will
preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD> tag's "align" attribute, and will
also preserve multiline text inside of a <TD> element provided it is broken using <BR/>
tags.
